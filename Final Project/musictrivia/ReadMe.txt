This music trivia quiz tests your knowledge of popular music facts. To play, drag the answer into the answer box underneath each question. If the answer is correct, it will be highlighted in green. If the answer is incorrect, it will be highlighted in red.

While this game is responsive, the answers and answer boxes are not the same exact size though the answer box does accept the answer and resize it. 

While there is validation that lets the player know if they got the answer wrong, it does not tell them what the correct answer is. This is something that would be included in a future release as well as a score to let them know how many they got correct once they have answered all of the questions.
